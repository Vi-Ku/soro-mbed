This is the mbed code repository for the 2015-16 Sooner Rover team.

This codebase is still under (semi) active development as it is being used for a teleoperation research project.

## Dependencies

Only the mbed-specific files are contained in this repository. All of the projects depend on the mbed-rtos and EthernetInterface libraries, as well as various files from the main [soro repository](https://github.com/doublejinitials/soro).
